    <p id = "question"> 
      Another glowing engraving appears on the wall:<br><br>

      "Some statements contain special logic operators, which compare two statements and are true under the conditions below. Unmet conditions make the entire statement false:<br><br>

      And is true when both statements are true.<br><br>

      Or is true when at least one of the statements are true.<br><br>

      Either ... or is true when only one of the statements are true. (This is false when both statements are true.)<br><br>

      Neither ... nor is true when both statements are false."<br><br>

      Suddenly, the engraving disappears. You sense a magical presence, and you will no longer be able to rely on this engraving.
