    <p id = "question"> 
      A glowing engraving appears on the wall:<br><br>

      "Some statements contain special logic operators, which compare two statements and are true under the conditions below. Unmet conditions make the entire statement false:<br><br>

      Greater than (>) is true when the left statement is larger than the right statement.<br><br>

      Less than (<) is true when the left statement is smaller than the right statement.<br><br>

      Equal (==) is true when both statements are the same.<br><br>

      Not equal (!=) is true when both statements are different from each other."<br><br>

      Suddenly, the engraving disappears. You sense a magical presence, and you will no longer be able to rely on this engraving.
