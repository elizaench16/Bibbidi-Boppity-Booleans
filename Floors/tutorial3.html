      The final glowing engraving appears on the wall:<br><br>

      "Some statements contain special logic operators, which compare two statements and are true under the conditions below. Unmet conditions make the entire statement false:<br><br>

      If ... then is true when one of the following condictions are true:<br>
      1. The first statement is true and the last statement is true. (This is true when both statements are true.)<br>
      2. The first statement is false (even when the last statement is true).<br><br>

      If ... then is only false  when the first statement is true and the last statement is false."<br><br>

      Suddenly, the engraving disappears. You sense a magical presence, and you will no longer be able to rely on this engraving.
